Come see your career take flight at NASA.

NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center nestled in the Maryland suburbs of Greenbelt is just 30 minutes from the heartbeat of America - Washington, D.C. Now you can have it all, the nightlife, museums, great food and theater.

This position requires a motivated and capable scientist with hands on experience using earth and atmospheric science data to provide end-to-end support for the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC). The successful candidate will have familiarity with remote sensing data, processing, and typical analysis involved in refining lower level data to higher level products and can facilitate the use of our NASA archived mission data and products with our users. These data products include legacy, current and future NASA Earth Science mission data (satellite and modeling), and discipline-related products (such as Atmospheric Composition, Climate, and Water Energy Cycle, hydrology, precipitation etc.) For more information about the GES DISC please visit our web site ( http://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ).

Position responsibilities will include (1) understanding the existing services associated with archived data at GES DISC (data formats and associated metadata), ability to plan, execute, and track projects and lead a small implementation team to meet project goals; (2) coordinating with stakeholders and communicate overall project objectives with internal team and external collaborators. The successful candidate is expected to have the ability to respond effectively to science data user questions on technical and scientific issues, provide technical and scientific support in enhancing and extending data and information services. As such, excellent communication skills (written and oral) are a must. A key ability will also be to help develop overall ""big picture"" strategies for future data science development directions for data services suitable for our data center services to better respond to our user community needs. The candidate will also need to demonstrate capabilities and interests to learn and apply new technologies to tasks at hand and commensurate familiarity with archival and commonly used data formats, data analysis tools, and relevant programming languages.

A key science service goal of our data center is developing online web accessible scientific applications and services (like our Giovanni analysis tool) or algorithms for generating value-added products (product generation executables) and applications to support advanced services that can be plugged into existing visualization and analysis systems, and developing tools to support interoperability for discovering, accessing, customizing, viewing, and analyzing data. The successful candidate as a task lead will also help management in developing requirements, and interact with other scientists and development teams in these goals which include developing extensive documentation on the data products and services, providing user-focused support, and supporting the GES DISC user outreach efforts.

Required:

• M.S./B.S. in physical or earth sciences or related engineering or remote sensing experience with 3+ years hands on experience supporting satellite mission data

• Experience leading small projects from inception through execution, creating and tracking schedules for milestones and deliveries

• Ability to work in a multi-task environment
• Excellent inter-personal and communications skills

• Motivated individual with a keen sense for problem solving and ability to work with little supervision and as part of a team

• USA Citizenship or Permanent Residency

Desired:

• Ph.D. in physical or earth sciences or related engineering or remote sensing experience with 2+ years hands on experience supporting satellite mission data

• 2+ years related experience; scientific programming experience and skill with use of languages such as (Python, IDL, perl, C/C++, Fortran) and data formats HDF/HDF-EOS, HDF5, netCDF4, GRIB, and metadata

• Experience in an operational data center or serving external users

• Self-motivated individual with experience or interest in leading projects

• Experience with proposal writing and development is plus

• Familiarity with UNIX/Linux environment

• Experience visualizing scientific data or presentation of data for outreach or to the larger user community."
